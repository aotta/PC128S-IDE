Some note for soldering:
the Edge pin 10 doesn't need to be connected, it was for experimenting 1 mhz port, but it didn't work with ide drive. So, you can solder a link for 2mhz in j4 between pin 2 and 3, and avoid the jumper.
Note it's needed the 74HCxx series, not the 74LSxx one.
Remind to solder the connector edge slot in the right way (soldering from component side, not the solder side!)

Feel free to improve or change the boards, and my credits to J.G. Harston for original schemes ( https://mdfs.net/Info/Comp/BBC/IDE/ )
